# 14 — Progress Ledger

*What has actually been built, what broke along the way, and what is owed. Append-only.*

The planning documents say what we intend to do. This one says what happened — including the parts that did not go to plan, which are usually the parts worth remembering.

**How to use it.** Append a dated entry when a phase or a tool reaches a stopping point. Each entry carries four things:

- **Built** — what exists now that did not before
- **Found & fixed** — bugs, wrong assumptions, and what the fix was. This is the most valuable section; a bug found once and forgotten is a bug found twice.
- **Decided** — judgement calls made during implementation that the plan left open. Contract changes go in [08-changelog.md](08-changelog.md) as well.
- **Deferred** — owed work, with the reason. Consolidated in §D at the bottom.

Do not rewrite history here. If something recorded turns out to be wrong, append a correction.

## 2026-08-22 → 08-24 · Phase 0 — Foundations

**Plan:** [04-phase-0-foundations.md](04-phase-0-foundations.md) · **Status: complete**

### Built

| Task | What landed |
|---|---|
| 0.1 | Python 3.12 + `uv`, ruff, mypy `--strict`, pytest, Makefile, `.env.example` |
| 0.2 | **The Scanner Contract, frozen.** `contracts/*.schema.json` (finding, evidence, scanresult, scanrun), `core/models.py`, `BaseScanner`, registry, `ScanContext`, kill switch, cost meter |
| 0.3 | `core/` services: `authz`, `dns`, `http`, `evidence`, `confidence`, `state`, `ratelimit`, `cost`, `killswitch` |
| 0.4 | `scan` CLI — `list`, `run`, `--format`, `--record`/`--replay`, `--out`, `--fail-on`, exit codes |
| 0.5 | `core/measurement.py` + `cli/corpus.py` — precision, recall, inconclusive rate, baseline comparison |
| 0.6 | `tools/registry.yaml`, licence policy check, architectural-invariant tests, CI workflow |
| 0.7 | `scanners/example/` reference scanner + `docs/how-to-add-a-scanner.md` |

The five design checks from task 0.2 were written as failing tests **before** the contract existed, and they remain its acceptance criteria.

### Found & fixed

**`checks_run` rejected the ordinary case.** The first version was a list of `check_id`s, and the ScanResult validator demanded a finding or a suppression record for each. That wrongly rejected a check that ran, found nothing wrong, and correctly said nothing. Now a list of `{check_id, location, outcome}` where `clear` is the honest name for that outcome. *Caught while writing the reference scanner — the first scanner to have a check that passes.*

**A `suspected` finding on a known-good target slipped the gate.** Deliberately broke the reference scanner so it fired on a correctly configured target. The injected false positive came back `suspected` (the independent re-query disagreed), and `suspected` is excluded from precision by design — so precision still read 1.000 and the build went green. Fixed: on a known-good target, hedges count as false positives. There is nothing to be uncertain about on an asset we know is correct, so a hedge there is a false positive wearing a hedge.

**The wildcard probe could never be replayed.** It uses a random DNS label on the wire, which is correct — a fixed one would be cached and could be special-cased by a target. But it meant no recorded corpus case was replayable. Fixture naming now canonicalises the random component; the recorded answer keeps the real name it used.

**`ruff format` reformatted the specification.** It rewrote a Python block inside `01-architecture.md`. Reverted, and `docs/` is now excluded from the formatter. The document set is the spec.

### Decided

- **Three additive contract fields** — `no_verdict_reason`, `telemetry.checks_run`, `analysis` on `dns_answer` evidence. All recorded with revert instructions in [08-changelog.md](08-changelog.md) §v3.2, because ADR-002 makes a contract change a migration rather than an edit.
- **State and ID are enforced, not just computed.** A `Finding` whose stored `state`, capped `confidence` or `id` disagrees with `core/state.py` is rejected outright. Hand-setting either is a loud failure.
- **Two truth-table orderings** the architecture document leaves ambiguous, fixed in `core/state.py`: the `< 0.40` reporting floor applies to every row after `inconclusive`, and `severity: info` is decided before validation outcome.
- **`expect_inconclusive` corpus cases.** [10-measurement.md](10-measurement.md) measures the inconclusive rate "where a definite answer is expected". A SERVFAIL fixture is not that, so those cases are excluded from the rate and asserted separately instead.

### Deferred

- CI workflow written but **never executed** — no remote existed at the time. → D1
- No docker-compose for the vulnerable targets. → resolved 2026-08-24, see below
- HTTP record/replay — DNS only. → D2
- Benchmark corpus tier wired as a concept only, per the plan's explicit deferral. → D3

## 2026-08-22 → 08-24 · Tool 1 — Email Security Scanner

**Plan:** [05-phase-1-first-tools.md](05-phase-1-first-tools.md) · **Gate: precision ≥ 0.99, recall ≥ 0.95, inconclusive ≤ 15%** · **Status: passing**

```
scanner   checks   TP   FP   FN  precision   recall   susp%  inconc%  gate
email        240   21    0    0      1.000    1.000    0.0%     0.8%  PASS
```

Plus a live sweep of **50 real domains: 8 flagged, all hand-verified true positives, zero false positives**, inconclusive rate 3.4% across 444 real checks.

### Built

- **RFC parsers, written as parsers rather than regexes** — SPF (7208), DMARC (7489), DKIM (6376). Each pure and separately tested before anything touched DNS.
- **17 checks** — 9 in Light, 8 more in Standard, all passive DNS.
- `resolve_spf_chain()` walks `include:`/`redirect=` recursively, detects loops, and returns `definite=False` when a SERVFAIL stopped it partway.
- DKIM key strength measured from the DER modulus, since no tag states it.
- 16-case ground-truth corpus, recorded by running the scanner itself through a recording resolver.

### Found & fixed

**Six checks were silently scoring zero recall.** Generating the corpus revealed them returning `suspected` rather than reported. Correct behaviour, badly configured: every check in this scanner observes one channel (DNS), so with a single `independence_class`, `confirmed` requires validation to have run *and* passed — and those six had no validation predicate. Each now re-tests through an independent resolver. `spf-lookup-limit` re-walks the **entire** include chain through the second resolver, because the finding rests on every record in it.

**A fabricated quote in a finding.** For `jpmorganchase.com` the description asserted *"Its SPF record is `v=spf1 -all`"*. Their record authorises nine IP ranges. Two causes: the no-mail test only looked for `include:` terms (they use `a:` and `ip4:`), and the description hardcoded the string instead of quoting what was read. **Putting words in a target's mouth is worse than reporting nothing.** Fixed by requiring every SPF term to be `all` before calling a domain silent, and by quoting the record as read. *Found only by the live sweep — invisible to the synthetic corpus.*

**Rate limiting the wrong thing.** A 50-domain sweep ran at ~50 seconds per domain. One limiter at 2 req/s was throttling DNS to `1.1.1.1`, and an email scan is ~25 lookups. The limit exists to protect systems we scan; a public recursive resolver is not one, and its cache is what keeps our lookups off the target's own nameservers. Split into `for_target()` (2/s) and `for_resolver()` (25/s), adaptive backoff unchanged on both. **50 domains: 40 minutes → 33 seconds.**

**`gov.uk` exposed a framing bug.** No MX is a true positive, but reporting *"medium: mail cannot be delivered"* against a domain publishing `v=spf1 -all` and `p=reject` is noise — that domain has said it sends no mail and is missing only the null MX that declares it. Severity is now keyed to whether an enforcing DMARC policy exists.

**A stale fixture crashed the whole corpus run.** Changing a scanner so it makes a new DNS query is ordinary mid-change work, but `MissingFixtureError` escaped and printed a stack trace from inside the resolver. Each case now catches it and reports as errored, and the message names the command that fixes it.

### Decided

- **`dkim-missing` can never be a confident finding.** DKIM selectors are chosen freely by the sender and cannot be enumerated; failing to guess one of 17 common names proves nothing. The check reaches a verdict only when it *finds* a key — otherwise `inconclusive` by construction. This is the single most likely place for a competitor to ship a false positive.
- **Wildcard zones downgrade presence, not absence.** A wildcard cannot mask a record that exists — a real answer wins over it — so absence findings stand, and downgrading them would cost recall for no honesty gained.
- **A check whose subject does not exist is not recorded in `checks_run` at all.** `dmarc-pct-partial` on a domain with no DMARC record did not run. Calling it `clear` would claim we checked and found nothing wrong; calling it `inconclusive` would bury the one finding that matters under five restatements.
- **Null MX (RFC 7505 `MX 0 .`) is recognised as the deliberate statement it is.**

### Deferred

- `open-relay`, `mail-tls-weak` — need an SMTP connection, which is active rather than passive. → D4
- `lookalike-domain` — needs RDAP over HTTP plus a permutation engine. → D5
- BIMI — its absence is a branding gap, not a security finding. Deliberately out of scope, not deferred.
- The ~50 real-domain frozen corpus tier the plan asks for. → D6

## 2026-08-24 · Supporting work

Not on the plan, built because the work needed it.

- **`docs/12-cli-runbook.md`** + published artifact — every command with real captured output.
- **`docs/13-test-targets.md`** + `docker-compose.yml` — Juice Shop, DVWA, VAmPI (vulnerable and safe), badssl. Closes the Phase 0.5 docker-compose item.
- **`config/authorised_scope.example.yaml`** — all four row shapes, annotated, runnable, and tested.
- **`scripts/authorise-domain.sh`** — issues a nonce, polls the zone's own authoritative nameservers, and writes the authorisation row **only after** seeing it. Verified: on timeout it writes nothing.
- **`scripts/scan-many.sh`** — Light-mode sweep over a domain list.
- **Guard tests** (`test_live_authorised_scope.py`) — a `self_owned` row may only target loopback or an RFC 2606 reserved name; public targets need real proof; every cited evidence file must exist; nothing runs past 90 days.

### Found & fixed

**A 30-minute wait for a record that was never saved.** `authorise-domain.sh` polled public resolvers, which cannot distinguish "you have not added it" from "you added it and it is spreading" — the one question that matters while waiting. It now polls the zone's authoritative nameservers first and says so within two minutes, and `--check` turns the feedback loop into five seconds.

## D. Deferred register

Single source of truth for what is owed. Move an item out only when it lands.

| # | Item | Why deferred | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** | Verify CI actually runs | No remote existed when it was written; one exists now, but no run has been observed | Nothing yet — but every gate claim rests on it |
| **D2** | HTTP record/replay | DNS only so far. The HTTP client captures redacted, size-capped pairs but has no replay backend | Tool 4 (Website Light) |
| **D3** | Benchmark corpus tier (OWASP Benchmark, WAVSEP) | Explicitly deferred by the plan until it has a consumer | Phase 2 web scanner |
| **D4** | `open-relay`, `mail-tls-weak` | Need SMTP connections — active, not passive; belong behind the authorisation gate | Nothing; Tool 1 passes without them |
| **D5** | `lookalike-domain` | Needs RDAP over HTTP plus a permutation engine; larger than the rest of Tool 1 combined | Nothing |
| **D6** | ~50 real domains recorded as a frozen corpus tier | The 16 committed cases are synthetic zones we wrote. Precision 1.000 against them proves the checks do what was intended, not that the intent matches the world | Confidence in the published number |
| **D7** | **CoreDNS container serving a local authoritative zone** | Standard-mode testing needs a zone we control. A local authoritative server on a reserved name (`sptest.test`) would make `self_owned` honest, exercise the real dnspython path instead of a fake resolver, and let us author any scenario — 11-lookup chains, weak DKIM keys, malformed DMARC — against real DNS. ~1 hour. Not built because Light-mode sweeps proved higher value first | Standard-mode live testing; a better Tool 1 corpus |
| **D8** | `evidence_file` existence check in `core/authz.py` | The loader checks the field is present, not that the file exists, so a scope file stays loadable outside the repo. Enforced on the committed file by test instead | Nothing; it is a belt-and-braces item |

## Next

**Tool 2 — SSL/TLS Analyzer.** Gate: precision ≥ 0.98, recall ≥ 0.95. `badssl.test` is already authorised in `config/authorised_scope.yaml`; the roadmap calls it a ready-made ground-truth corpus. Recall is true recall here, as with email — the protocol, cipher and certificate surface is finite.

**Open before starting:** whether to shell out to `testssl.sh` or write our own TLS inspection. See [07-open-questions.md](07-open-questions.md) Q12b.
